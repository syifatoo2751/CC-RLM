"""
Session deduplication tracker.

Prevents re-injecting file content that Claude has already seen this session
and that hasn't changed since. On multi-turn conversations, this is the biggest
lever for token reduction — turns 2-N cost near-zero for unchanged context.

Session identity: (repo_path, date-hour bucket) — rough enough to group a
work session together without bleeding across different tasks or days.

Design:
- In-memory only (per-process). Clears on server restart or session expiry.
- Tracks {file_path: last_mtime_seen} per session.
- If a file's current mtime == last mtime seen, skip it.
- Files with changes since last injection are always re-included.

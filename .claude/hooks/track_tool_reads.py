"""
PostToolUse hook — tool-call awareness tracker.

Fires after each Read, Edit, Write, or MultiEdit tool call.
Records which files Claude has in its context window as a result of tool calls,
so the RLM session deduplicator knows not to re-inject them.

This closes the gap where Claude reads a file via the Read tool, then RLM
injects the same file again in the next turn's context pack — doubling the tokens.

State file: /tmp/cc-rlm-tool-reads.json
  ["abs/path/to/file.py", ...]

Cleared by inject_repo_context.py at the start of each new user turn.
